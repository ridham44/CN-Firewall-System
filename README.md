## Introduction  
The **Firewall Rule Management System** is a Python-based tool designed to help manage and validate firewall rules for TCP and UDP traffic. Firewalls act as the first line of defense in securing computer networks, allowing or blocking traffic based on pre-defined rules. This project provides a simplified platform to define, validate, and test custom firewall rules effectively.  

---

## Features  
- **Support for TCP and UDP Traffic**: Manage rules for both major protocols.  
- **Dynamic Rule Management**: Load rules directly from a CSV file.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Test network traffic rules dynamically.  
- **Customizable Rules**: Define rules for any combination of source/destination IP addresses, ports, and actions.  
- **Beginner-Friendly Structure**: Clean and modular codebase for easy understanding and extension.

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Firewall-Rule-Management.git  
   cd Firewall-Rule-Management  
   ```  

2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. Prepare your `rules.csv` file with desired firewall rules (sample format provided below).  

---

## Usage  
1. Run the program:  
   ```bash  
   python main.py  
   ```  

2. Follow the interactive prompts:  
   - **Interface to monitor** (e.g., `eth0`, `eth1`)  
   - **Protocol** (`TCP` or `UDP`)  
   - **Source IP Address**  
   - **Destination IP Address**  
   - **Source Port**  
   - **Destination Port**  

3. The system will validate traffic based on the `rules.csv` file and display whether the connection is **ALLOWED** or **DENIED**.

## Example Rules  
Sample `rules.csv`:  
```csv  
Action,Source IP,Source Port,Destination IP,Destination Port  
allow,192.168.1.1,22,192.168.1.2,80  
deny,192.168.1.2,22,192.168.1.3,80  
allow,192.168.1.1,22,any,any  
disable,192.168.1.3,22,192.168.1.4,80  
allow,192.168.1.1,443,192.168.1.5,443  
deny,192.168.1.4,21,192.168.1.6,21  
allow,any,80,192.168.1.7,80  
allow,192.168.1.8,53,any,any  
deny,192.168.1.9,22,192.168.1.10,22  
disable,any,any,any,any  
```

## Real-Life Applications  
1. **Corporate Networks**: Protect sensitive company data by ensuring only authorized devices and services communicate within the network.  
2. **Cloud Environments**: Manage firewall rules in cloud-based systems like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.  
3. **Home Networks**: Secure personal devices against unauthorized access.  
4. **ISP Filtering**: Implement rule-based filtering to regulate internet traffic in Internet Service Providers' networks.
